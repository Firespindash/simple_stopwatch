## Installation
Clone this repository, then open the **index.html** file in your browser.

## About
I created this app, because I could not found a stopwatch app, that worked how a digital stopwatch do.
It blinks, can be stopped or restarted. Now, it has keyboard shortcuts. Mainly, it is really simple, doing just the thing it was meant to.
I pretend to make it a mobile native app using something like _Ionic_. \
For any demands, just contact me via email.

## Usage
Just click over it or press any key, and it will start. \
To stop/pause it, click over it or press any key again. \
To reload, reload the page or, press 'r' or 'Esc' or 'Backspace'. \
If you want, you can note your times/laps using a note application.
It can also be used for testing your reaction time speeds, and improve concentration, surprisingly. \
And maybe to benchmark hardware response speeds. \
In my tests I realized that screens are better than mouses in making you be faster, apparently.
